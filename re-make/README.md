Remake in flask

1.  One thing I need to figure out is to do the crawling in jinja, javascript, or python
  1.  The thing about doing it in python is that it would be much easier BUT I am not sure how to send my intermediate results to the results page otherwise I would find all the results and then print them all at once... I could add some random printing so it prints slower. So I send a array of arrays of URLs.
  2.  javascript I could print the intermediate results BUT I can't find out how to open pages!
  3.  Jinja IDK lol!
